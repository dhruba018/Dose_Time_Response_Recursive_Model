### Dose_time_Response_Recursive_Model  
Majority of the drug sensitivity prediction models attempt to predict a single representative metric of the complete dose-response curve such as IC<sub>50</sub> or AUC 

A recursive hybrid methodology modeling the dose-time drug response in pharmacological studies. 
'RecursiveHybridModel.m' contains the model class with all necessary functions. A synthetic data example of model application is provided in 'synthetic_data_analysis_SRD_v2.m'. The data is included in 'synthetic_recursive.mat'. Relevant publication: https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-019-2831-4
